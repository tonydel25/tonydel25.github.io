I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and I hope to be able to graduate by the year 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1
    This was a fun lab because it was my first lab and the first time I coded. It was a really fun activity in learning the basics in coding and learning it along with my partner. Making a top lab for me for the memory of just being introduced to the world of coding.

* Lab 7
    This was a great lab because it made me proud of being able to work the code out with my partner. We worked our way through, asking questions and trying to figure out what to add to the code. Eventually leading to us finishing the code and learning more about coding through teamwork. This lab also demonstrated how helpful it is to have a partner to work with since it makes the process easier.

* Lab 8
    This was another great lab to do since it was with the same partner as lab 7. This lab also was fun in being able to work together to get the job done. It really showed the good side about switching partners every time since this actually seemed like a good partnership. It was sad that this was the last lab with that partner, but it was still a great time and why I hold this lab as special.
